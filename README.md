# tab-bound
This Firefox extension enforces a limit on the number of tabs in a window (configurable through the extension's `Preferences` page). I created this app to help me stay focused and productive while also helping my PCs RAM.
Please use this extension with caution as I have zero experience with Firefox extension development and hold no standards regarding safety, security or "correctness".


This application deletes a tab upon creation if the total number of tabs exceeds the allowed maximum tab number and the activation checkbox is checked. If this extension finds itself in a state where the number of existing tabs already exceeds the allowed maximum tab number, no existing tabs will be removed.
